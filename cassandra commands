#Instructions for using my Ghibli films csv in Cassandra to be called by the API

#Update all files and packages to make sure they are up to date
sudo apt update

#Install docker if it's not already installed
sudo apt install docker.io

#Pull Cassandra from docker images
sudo docker pull cassandra:latest

#Run the Cassandra docker image as 'ghibli_films' at port 9042
sudo docker run --name ghibli_films -p 9042:9042 -d cassandra:latest

#Copy my csv data (From the orginal api) to the container inside the home file
sudo docker cp ghibli_films.csv ghibli_films:home/ghibli_films.csv

#Open CQL Shell to create the table
sudo docker exec -it ghibli_films cqlsh

#Creating the Keysapce for the table itself, called Ghibli
CREATE KEYSPACE ghibli WITH REPLICATION = {'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1};

#Create the Table we wish to use (In this case Films table) with all the relevant headers, their data type and the Primary Key for this table (Title)
CREATE TABLE ghibli.films (id text, title text PRIMARY KEY, description text, director text, producer text, release_date int, rt_score int);

#Finally copy the csv file to this table with all the headers organised, a file to copy to and a delimeter to split the CSV file correctly
COPY ghibli.films(id,title,description,director,producer,release_date,rt_score) FROM '/home/ghibli_films.csv' WITH DELIMITER=',' AND HEADER=TRUE;

#Simple test to ensure it is running correctly by finding the film details for When Marnie was There. This container running Cassandra is left running
SELECT * from ghibli.films where title = 'When Marnie Was There' ALLOW FILTERING;

#Exit the cqlsh
exit

#This is then used to find the IP address of the container to allow my api to connect to it
sudo docker inspect ghibli_films

#Finally build a separate API container to hold our API which can then call to the Cassandra container for data
sudo docker build . --tag=cassandrarest:v1

#Run the API container at Port 80 to start the API with both this and the cassandra container running at the same time
sudo docker run -p 80:80 cassandrarest:v1
